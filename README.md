## Welcome!

This is where you can find most of my OS work, which happen to be  things I do for a living and things I do just because I want to - and fortunately, thanks to being my own boss, most projects are both.

The focus is on (home)automation and more recently in particular, matter - [vdcd](https://github.com/plan44/vdcd), [p44mbrd](https://github.com/plan44/p44mbrd). One special topic are WS28xx SmartLEDs, and their use in (home)automation, this is what the special graphics subsystem [p44lrgraphics](https://github.com/plan44/p44lrgraphics) is about. Many projects are based on a toolkit for single-threaded, event driven C++ automation daemons named [p44utils](https://github.com/plan44/p44utils). And because I run most of my software on embedded targets powered by OpenWrt/Linux, there's a openwrt package feed [plan44-feed](https://github.com/plan44/plan44-feed) with all my own and some ported packages I am using.
